# Library app
## The Odin Project

A simple library application allowing users to keep track of the books they are reading. 

This project was an exercise in using Object Constructors and utilizing local storage. 

An object constructor was used as the means of creating a new book object when a user submits their title in the form. 

Local storage is utilized here as a lightweight way for books to be accessible after leaving the page.
